    "# Homework nr. 3 - features transformation & selection (deadline 13/12/2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the main task is to play with transformations and feature selection methods in order to obtain the best results for linear regression model predicting house sale prices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "> The instructions are not given in details: It is up to you to come up with ideas on how to fulfill the particular tasks as best you can. ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are you supposed to do\n",
    "\n",
    "Your aim is to optimize the _RMSLE_ (see the note below) of the linear regression estimator (=our prediction model) of the observed sale prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Download the dataset from the course pages (hw3_data.csv, hw3_data_description.txt). It corresponds to [this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).\n",
    "  2. Split the dataset into train & test part exactly as we did in the tutorial.\n",
    "  3. Transform the features properly (don't forget the target variable).\n",
    "  4. Try to find the best subset of features.\n",
    "  5. Compare your results with the [Kaggle leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/leaderboard). You should be able to reach approximately the top 20% there.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Give comments on each step of your solution, with short explanations of your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Note**: _RMSLE_ is a Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sale prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Please follow the instructions from https://courses.fit.cvut.cz/MI-PDD/homeworks/index.html.\n",
    "  * If the reviewing teacher is not satisfied, he can give you another chance to rework your homework and to obtain more points."
